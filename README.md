Introduction
Optuna is a framework designed for the automatic optimization of hyperparameters in machine learning models. It is efficient, flexible, and allows for both random and grid search techniques, as well as state-of-the-art algorithms like Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) and Bayesian Optimization.

This tutorial notebook covers:

The basic setup of an Optuna study.
How to define an objective function.
How to run optimization trials.
Visualization of optimization results.
Requirements
To run the notebook in this repository, you will need the following Python libraries:

optuna
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
You can install all the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install optuna scikit-learn numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optuna_basics.git
cd optuna_basics
Install the dependencies:
bash
